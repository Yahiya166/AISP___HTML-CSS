        <h2>Risk Management</h2>
        <p>
          Public awareness of hazards and risks has enhanced the importance of
          safety assessment and management in today’s increasingly litigious
          society. Risk and safety issues need to be evaluated in a structured
          and calculated manner but in the light of an overall organisational
          strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
          This course aims to provide students with advanced knowledge of risk
          assessment techniques, the public and individual perception of risk,
          and how decisions are made in competitive business markets. The
          course focuses on practical applications of safety methodologies,
          ergonomics and human factors, and safety and risk management
          techniques. It will develop students’ skills to undertake safety
          studies and manage safety and risk to the best national and
          international standards.

                The MSc/Postgraduate Diploma in Safety and Risk Management,
                led by Professor Guy Walker, is only available by
                attendance-free distance learning.
              </p>
              <p>
                The programme comprises eight taught courses. Heriot-Watt
                Online students must first take exams in two courses of the
                programme, Human Factors Methods and Learning from Disasters.
                Based on the results from these courses students continue on
                the programme at MSc or at PG Diploma level.
              </p>
              <p>
                All courses have written examinations and some have compulsory
                coursework elements. MSc students are also required to
                complete a Masters dissertation.
