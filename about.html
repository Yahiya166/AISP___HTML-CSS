                    <h2>The <span>Beginning</span></h2>
                    <p>The origins of Global OSHA began in the early 2000s when Jim Barnes joined the OSHA Directorate
                        of Training and Education (DTE). Ernest Thompson had initiated the OTI Education Center program
                        in 1992 and, after a promotion, hired Jim to manage the program. Hank Payne was the senior
                        executive responsible for all OSHA training programs, including the OSHA Training Institute
                        (OTI). Don Guerra had already managed the Outreach Training Program for more than a decade. The
                        four enjoyed great success as they worked closely together on training policy and programs. </p>

                <div class="right">
                    <h2>Growth and <span>Change</span></h2>
                    <p>The next few years were a time of considerable growth and significant change at DTE. During the
                        period 2002-2015, the OTI Education Center program grew from 11 organizations to more than 40.
                        Annual enrollment numbers saw increases which averaged in the double digits during this time
                        period. The Outreach Training Program added two targeted programs and saw its annual training
                        numbers grow exponentially; topping 750,000 by 2015. In 2006, Ernie Thompson was named Deputy
                        Director and Jim Barnes was promoted to Director of Training Programs and Administration. After
                        30 years of serving in field and management positions for OSHA, Charlie Shields joined DTE as
                        the Director for the OSHA Training Institute in early 2007. Jim, Hank, Charlie, Ernie, and Don
                        worked together on various worker safety and health training programs. They developed strong
                        working relationships as they embraced emerging trends in safety and health training and
                        addressed some complex issues. </p>

                        and implemented key quality improvement measures. This included new outreach training programs
                        for disaster site workers and those in the maritime industry, as well as an outreach program for
                        workers in the state of California. It also included new courses on cranes in construction, oil
                        and gas exploration and production, and pandemic flu. They worked to implement blended learning,
                        four-level training evaluation, more rigorous testing procedures, stronger controls for online
                        outreach training, and enhanced instructor qualifications. Their efforts were recognized with
                        numerous awards from both OSHA and the Department of Labor.</p>

                    <h2>Representing OSHA with Global Stakeholders</h2>
                    <p>During their time with OSHA, Hank and Jim both represented the agency in international
                        partnerships and alliances on multiple occasions. They worked together on the OSHA occupational
                        safety and health initiative with Canada and Mexico to share best practices for worker training.
                        Under Hank's direction, OTI instructors conducted training sessions for compliance personnel for
                        both Mexico and Canada under the North American Free Trade Agreement. Jim served as the OSHA
                        liaison for international visitors to the Directorate of Training and Education. Hank traveled
                        to India to meet with government officials and direct on-site consultation and training for
                        safety and health inspectors in both Faridabad and New Delhi in coordination with U.S.

                    <h2>Global Demand for OSHA Training Programs</h2>
                    <p>In 2010, OSHA discontinued allowing its training programs to be conducted outside agency
                        jurisdiction. OTI Education Center courses and Outreach Training Program classes could not be
                        conducted outside of OSHA's geographic jurisdiction without special permission and advance
                        notification. This proved burdensome and effectively prevented all but a few classes to be held
                        outside the U.S. However, DTE continued to receive requests for OSHA training programs outside
                        the U.S. on a regular basis. Some requests were from U.S.-based companies; other requests were
                        from companies that were simply familiar with the OSHA training programs. Whatever the reason,
                        the global demand for OSHA training programs remained very strong.</p>

                <h2>The Concept for Global OSHA</h2>
                <p>By 2018, Jim and Hank were no longer with OSHA. But they continued to have an interest in worker
                    safety and health training. Their ongoing discussions on the topic led them to consider ideas for
                    launching a training organization based on their previous experience with OSHA. Aware of the global
                    demand for high quality occupational safety and health training, and mindful of their unique
                    experience developing and delivering training programs for the U.S. Department of Labor, they
                    developed the framework for Global OSHA. This concept would allow them to use their expertise to
                    develop a global network of authorized trainers who can conduct worker training worldwide; <i>with
                        no geographic limitations.</i></p>
                <br>
                <h2>The Team</h2>
                <p>Through it all, Hank, Jim, Charlie, Ernie, and Don formed lasting friendships that endured even after
                    all five had left OSHA. So Jim and Hank invited their former colleagues to join them in the new
                    venture and were able to bring together the former nucleus of the DTE senior management team. With
                    Global OSHA, they have roles similar to their OSHA positions; Ernie Thompson overseeing curriculum
                    and partnerships; Charlie directing the instructors; and Don directing the Global Outreach Training
                    Program. These five colleagues, who also became friends, are now reunited at Global OSHA for a
                    common goal - the advancement of worker safety and health worldwide. For workers around the globe,
                    this truly is a dream team for occupational safety and health training. </i></p>
